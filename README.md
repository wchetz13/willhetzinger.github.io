# William Hetzinger — Quantitative Finance & ML Portfolio

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of applied quantitative finance, stochastic modeling, numerical methods, and production-style analytical systems built in Python.

These projects are designed to demonstrate practical understanding of:

- Derivatives pricing and sensitivity analysis
- Monte Carlo methods and variance reduction
- Time series modeling and risk analytics
- Optimization under constraints
- Data pipelines and analytical system design

Each project is self-contained with full documentation, reproducible code, and visual validation.

## Projects

### Monte Carlo Simulation for Pricing Under Uncertainty
Monte Carlo option pricing engine with antithetic variates, control variates, Black–Scholes validation, standard error reporting, and convergence analysis.

---

### Options Payoff & Greeks Modeling 

Analytical and numerical Greeks, payoff diagrams, and sensitivity visualizations for European options.

---

### Time Series Forecasting of Margin & Returns *(coming next)*

ARIMA/Prophet/ML models applied to financial return forecasting with backtesting and error analysis.

---

### Risk Clustering & Anomaly Detection *(coming next)*

Unsupervised learning applied to risk segmentation and anomaly detection in financial data.

---

### Pricing Optimization Under Constraints *(coming next)*

Optimization techniques applied to pricing strategy under business and risk constraints.

---

### Production Risk Dashboard & Data Pipeline *(coming next)*

End-to-end data ingestion, transformation, and risk reporting pipeline with visualization.

## About

I work at the intersection of pricing strategy, quantitative modeling, and applied data science.  
These projects reflect a focus on using mathematical, statistical, and computational methods to analyze uncertainty, model financial risk, and build decision systems that translate theory into practical application.
