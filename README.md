# William Hetzinger — Quantitative Finance & ML Portfolio

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of applied quantitative finance, stochastic modeling, numerical methods, and production-style analytical systems built in Python.

These projects are designed to demonstrate practical understanding of:

- Derivatives pricing and sensitivity analysis
- Monte Carlo methods and variance reduction
- Time series modeling and risk analytics
- Optimization under constraints
- Data pipelines and analytical system design

Each project is self-contained with full documentation, reproducible code, and visual validation.
